              <p class="py-4">Pre-money valuation refers to the value of a company before it receives new financing or capital
                injection.<br><br>Post-money valuation is the value of the company immediately after it receives that
                financing.<br><br>The difference between them is the amount of new financing added. For example, if a company
                has a pre-money valuation of $100 million and receives $25 million in new investment, its post-money
                valuation would be $125 million.</p>

            <p><a class="underline" href="https://simonsinek.com/">Simon Sinek's</a> central thesis is that most companies do business from the outside in, starting with the "what"
              and moving to the "how," but very few focus on the "why." However, companies that are more successful and
              influential operate from the inside out, starting with "why."</p>
            <div class="">
              <strong class="text-2xl  underline">Key Points</strong>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-4 pt-1">
                <li class="pb-2"><span class="kalam-bold">Inspiration Over Manipulation</span> - Sinek argues that
                  companies should
                  focus on why they exist rather than what they do or how they do it. By doing so, they inspire
                  stakeholders rather than manipulate them to achieve sales or engagement.</li>

                <li class="pb-2"><span class="kalam-bold">The Law of Diffusion of Innovation</span> - Sinek refers to
                  this law to
                  explain how innovations achieve mass-market success once they reach an adoption rate of 15% to 18%,
                  which corresponds to the "early adopters" stage. He connects this to why companies should attract
                  those who believe what they believe (share the same "why").</li>

                <li class="pb-2"><span class="kalam-bold">Leaders Need a Strong 'Why'</span> - Leaders who articulate
                  and embody
                  their organization's "why" are better able to inspire action in others. A strong "why" acts as a
                  rallying cry that can drive collective action.</li>

                <li class="pb-2"><span class="kalam-bold">Real-World Examples</span> - Sinek uses Apple, Martin Luther
                  King Jr., and
                  the Wright brothers as examples of how starting with "why" creates a powerful drive to do great
                  things. For instance, Apple's success is attributed to its clear purpose and belief in challenging the
                  status quo and thinking differently.</li>

                <li class="pb-2"><span class="kalam-bold">Trust and Loyalty</span> - Starting with "why" builds trust
                  among consumers
                  and creates loyal followers. Sinek discusses how trust emerges when people are confident they share
                  values and beliefs with a company.</li>

                choice largely depends on an investor's specific circumstances, objectives, and investment acumen...</p>
