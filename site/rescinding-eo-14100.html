                    The Impact of Rescinding Executive Order 14110: What It
                    Means for AI Governance
                </h1>

                <p>
                    On January 20, 2025, within hours of assuming office,
                    President Donald Trump rescinded Executive Order 14110, a
                    comprehensive directive issued by President Joe Biden in
                    October 2023 to establish a national framework for the
                    governance of artificial intelligence (AI). The move raises
                    critical questions about the future of AI policy in the
                    United States. Here's a look at what this decision means in
                    practical terms.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h4><strong>What Was Executive Order 14110?</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Executive Order 14110, titled
                    <em
                        >Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of
                        Artificial Intelligence</em
                    >, was designed to guide the development, deployment, and
                    governance of AI in the United States. It outlined a series
                    of ambitious goals, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-4 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                        Promoting competition and innovation in the AI industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Protecting civil liberties and consumer rights from
                        AI-enabled threats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strengthening national security through AI safeguards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developing tools like watermarking systems to identify
                        AI-generated content.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The order also required federal agencies to appoint chief AI
                    officers and tasked them with creating AI-specific
                    guidelines and policies. Agencies such as the Department of
                    Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of
                    Standards and Technology (NIST) were given specific
                    responsibilities, ranging from improving cybersecurity to
                    managing AI risks.
                </p>

                        >The Practical Implications of Rescinding the
                        Order</strong
                    >
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Revoking this order has significant ramifications for AI
                    governance and the broader AI landscape. Here’s what the
                    change means:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Halted Agency Obligations</strong> Agencies are
                        no longer mandated to comply with the order’s
                        requirements, including appointing chief AI officers or
                        developing AI-specific guidelines. Initiatives such as
                        AI competitions for reducing healthcare worker burnout
                        or AI-related risk management frameworks may come to a
                        standstill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduced Federal Coordination on AI</strong>
                        The order provided a unified framework for addressing AI
                        challenges, such as bias, misinformation, and national
                        security risks. Without it, federal agencies may develop
                        inconsistent approaches to AI governance, leaving
                        critical gaps in oversight and regulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Uncertainty in AI Regulation</strong> The
                        removal of a central directive creates ambiguity in how
                        AI technologies should be regulated. Key issues such as
                        privacy protections, intellectual property rights for
                        AI-generated content, and the ethical use of AI may
                        remain unaddressed, leaving room for industry confusion
                        and public concern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong
                            >Potential Shifts in AI Funding Priorities</strong
                        >
                        Executive Order 14110 prioritised investment in federal
                        AI research and development. With the order rescinded,
                        funding and focus may shift elsewhere, potentially
                        slowing innovation and weakening public-sector
                        contributions to the AI ecosystem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong
                            >A Return to Earlier Policies or a New
                            Approach</strong
                        >
                        Rescinding the order may signal a return to Trump-era AI
                        policies or the introduction of a new framework. The
                        direction the administration takes will determine
                        whether AI development aligns with global standards or
                        diverges toward deregulation.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <hr />
                <h4><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The rapid growth of AI technologies requires robust,
                    adaptable governance to ensure safety, fairness, and
                    innovation. Executive Order 14110 aimed to strike this
                    balance by addressing immediate risks while fostering
                    long-term opportunities. Its repeal leaves a void in federal
                    AI policy, potentially affecting global competitiveness and
                    public trust in AI systems.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h4><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The decision to rescind Executive Order 14110 is a pivotal
                    moment for U.S. AI policy. While the Trump administration
                    may introduce new AI-related measures, the absence of a
                    comprehensive framework creates uncertainty for federal
                    agencies, private industry, and civil society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the AI landscape evolves, the need for clear, actionable
                    governance remains more pressing than ever. Whether through
                    legislation, new executive action, or international
                    cooperation, the future of AI policy in the United States
                    hinges on balancing innovation with responsible oversight.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    This development underscores the importance of keeping an
                    eye on federal policies and their broader implications. As
                    the story unfolds, it will shape not only the AI industry
                    but also the lives of citizens who interact with these
                    transformative technologies.
