                    We're building Ninja, a platform that lets developers
                    create, host, and sell tools that AI agents (like ChatGPT,
                    Claude, or custom agents) can use to take real-world
                    actions—e.g. sending emails, querying APIs, or updating
                    CRMs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These tools run as MCP servers (Model Context Protocol),
                    which expose structured capabilities that agents can safely
                    invoke. Ninja provides a full developer toolchain (CLI,
                    server builder, test harness), a hosting layer (via AWS
                    Lambda), observability (event logs, cost tracing, secrets
                    management), and a marketplace for discoverability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agents connect via open standards (MCP), and users can chat
                    with tools, invoke workflows, or build their own. Our goal
                    is to become the Heroku + App Store for AI-native
                    automation.

                    After YC, I'd relocate to San Francisco (at least part-time)
                    to be closer to the AI ecosystem, potential partners (like
                    OpenAI, Anthropic), and investors. SF is the centre of
                    gravity for agent platforms and infra, and proximity is
                    critical for building the right relationships at this stage.
                    That said, our product and team are built to be global from
                    day one.

                    In just over two months, I've built and launched the full
                    platform solo — covering the automatic generation of MCP
                    Servers, CLI tooling, hosting infrastructure, chat
                    interface, analytics, billing, and marketplace. We've
                    onboarded hundreds of users, deployed dozens of tools, and

                    PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq. Frontend uses Hotwire,

                    Internal tools include a REPL agent that incrementally
                    constructs workflows from natural language, and a
                    Strands-style DAG engine for execution, testing, and

                    Everything is designed to be agent-native, low-latency, and
                    introspectable — so agents can safely take real-world
                    actions.

                    through marketplace sales by end users. There's no paywall,
                    and users have to go out of their way — navigating through

                    Right now, all revenue is from the Ninja platform, but it's
                    minimal and incidental — 7 users have manually subscribed
                    without any paywall or prompt. We haven't launched pricing
                    publicly yet.

                            usage-based sales when agents invoke tools from
                            third-party builders.

                            developers and companies to host tools (MCP servers)
                            with observability, billing, and security features.

                <p>
                    As developers began deploying MCPs, the core question
                    quickly became: &quot;I have an MCP… now what?&quot;
                    Interacting with a tool via prompt alone turned out to be
                    clunky and unintuitive. We learned that just having a hosted
                    tool wasn't enough — developers needed ways to use it
                    meaningfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That insight led us to build features like scheduled tasks,
                    chat interfaces, and workflow triggers to make MCPs actually
                    usable in practice. It's not just about hosting — it's about
                    activating the tool in a way that feels native, repeatable,
                    and useful.

                    Yes — we were accepted into <a href="https://startmate.com.au" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline" target="_blank">Startmate</a> (Winter 2025) on

                    I picked this idea out of direct frustration. At Little Bird
                    and Pi Australia, we run a thin-margin electronics business,
                    so I've been automating everything — from shipping labels to
                    warehouse robots. But when I needed to book a plumber, there
                    was no way to get an AI to just do it. It should have been
                    able to check my calendar, negotiate a quote, and send my
                    address — autonomously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's when I started experimenting with Model Context
                    Protocol (MCP) tools. I thought it would be easy to layer
                    some structure on top of existing web functionality and
                    generate tools automatically. But the reality was far worse:
                    building MCPs was doable — but hosting, triggering, using,
                    and discovering them sucked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have deep domain experience across automation,
                    integration, and developer tooling (15+ years) — and I've
                    now seen dozens of early adopters run into the exact same
                    wall: &quot;I built a tool… now what?&quot; That gap is
                    exactly what Ninja solves.

                    <li>LangChain / AutoGen /
                    CrewAI – Great for building agent workflows, but lack

                    <li>Vercel / Replit / Modal – Strong
                    infra platforms, but they're app-first, not
                    tool-for-agent-first. None of them natively support
                    agent-triggered execution or the MCP standard.</li>

                    / Anthropic Tools – Closed ecosystems with limited tooling
                    discoverability, no ownership control, and no cross-agent

                    We're designing tools to be invoked by agents, not through
                    users. That shift in UX assumption changes everything from
                    schema design to invocation flow.

                            cut of the usage fees (similar to an app store
                            model).

                <p>How much could we make?</p>
                <p>
                    There are already zillions of AI agents (GPTs, Claude tools,
                    RAG pipelines, internal copilots) that need structured,
                    secure access to real-world actions. If Ninja powers even a
                    fraction of the agent-to-tool market:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With 100,000 active tools doing $50/month in usage, that's
                        $60M/year gross, with Ninja taking a 20–30% cut.</li>
                        <li>Add
                        20,000 developers on hosting plans at $20–$200/month, and
                        platform revenue could exceed $20–40M/year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long-term, if agent usage explodes (as we believe it will),
                    Ninja becomes the default infrastructure layer for tool
                    invocation—like what Stripe did for payments, or Vercel for
                    deployment. The ceiling is extremely high.
